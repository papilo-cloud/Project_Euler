# Project Euler Solutions in Python

1. [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/Project_Euler/blob/main/src/multiples_of_3_or_5.py) If we list all the natural numbers below __10__ that are multiples of __3__ or __5__, we get __3__,
__5__, __6__, and __9__. The sum of these multiples is __23__. Find the sum of all the multiples of __3__ 
or __5__ below __1000__.

2. [Even Fibonacci Numbers](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/Project_Euler/blob/main/src/fibonacci_numbers.py) Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with __1__ and __2__, the first __10__ terms will be: __1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89__
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

3. [Largest Prime Factors](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/Project_Euler/blob/main/src/prime_factor.py) The prime factors of __13195__ are __5, 7, 13,__ and __29__.
What is the largest prime factor of the number __600851475143?__
?

4. [Largest Palindrome Product](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/Project_Euler/blob/main/src/largest_palindrome_product.py) A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two __2__-digit numbers is __9009__ = __91__ x __99__.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 
__3__-digit numbers.

5. [Smallest Multiple](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/Project_Euler/blob/main/src/smallest_multiple.py) __2520__ is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from __1__ to __10__
without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is __evenly divisible__ by all of the numbers from __1__ to __20__ ?
