# Project Euler Solutions in Python

1. [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/Project_Euler/blob/main/src/multiples_of_3_or_5.py) If we list all the natural numbers below __10__ that are multiples of __3__ or __5__, we get __3__,
__5__, __6__, and __9__. The sum of these multiples is __23__. Find the sum of all the multiples of __3__ 
or __5__ below __1000__.

2. [Even Fibonacci Numbers](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/Project_Euler/blob/main/src/fibonacci_numbers.py) Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with __1__ and __2__, the first __10__ terms will be: __1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89__
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

3. [Largest Prime Factors](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/Project_Euler/blob/main/src/prime_factor.py) The prime factors of __13195__ are __5, 7, 13,__ and __29__.
What is the largest prime factor of the number __600851475143?__
?

4. [Largest Palindrome Product](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/Project_Euler/blob/main/src/largest_palindrome_product.py) A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two __2__-digit numbers is __9009__ = __91__ x __99__.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 
__3__-digit numbers.

5. [Smallest Multiple](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/Project_Euler/blob/main/src/smallest_multiple.py) __2520__ is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from __1__ to __10__
without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is __evenly divisible__ by all of the numbers from __1__ to __20__ ?

6. [Sum Square Difference](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/Project_Euler/blob/main/src/sum_square_difference.py) The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, __1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385__
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, __(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025__
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is . __3025 - 385 = 2640__
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

7. [10001st prime](https://github.com/papilo-cloud/Project_Euler/blob/main/src/nth_prime.py) By listing the first six prime numbers: __2, 3, 5, 7, 11,__ and __13__, we can see that the __6__ th prime is __13__.
What is the __10001__ st prime number?
